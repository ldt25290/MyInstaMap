# MyInstaMap
Coding Challenge

To login app, please contact and send me instagram username or email to invite to sandbox.</br>
</br>
Below is app features:</br>
- Login to get access_token and logout.</br>
- Search and display info of the instagram post on the map.</br>
- Save image to Photos or share image to social network.</br>

Note: Because there were some changes on instagram api from 1st Jun 2016, so app needs access_token to call endpoints and instagram username or email invite to sandbox.</br>
