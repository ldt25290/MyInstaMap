# MyInstaMap
Coding Challenge

In order to login app, please contact and send me instagram username or email to invite to sandbox.</br>
</br>
Below is app features:</br>
- Login to get access_token and logout.</br>
- Search and display info of the instagram post on the map.</br>

Because there are some changes on instagram api, so it needs access_token to call endpoint and invite to sandbox.</br>
